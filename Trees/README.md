# Trees

+ *BayesTraits_VarRates_MeanScalar.trees*: a nexus file of median-scalar transformed trees for each morphological trait. 

+ *Tiliquini_AHE_genetrees.trees*: IQTREE2 estimated locus trees for all AHE loci. 

+ *Tiliquini_forR.tre*: time-calibrated tree trimmed down to species level for comparative analyses.

+ *Tiliquini_forR_wFossils.tre*: time-calibrated tree trimmed down to species level for comparative analyses, including fossil taxa.

+ *Tiliquini_hASTRAL_FullSampling.tre*: species tree estimated by hybrid-ASTRAL using the IQTREE estimated locus trees (above) as input, but with all samples represented. 

+ *Tiliquini_MCMCtree.tre*: time-calibrated tree estimated from MCMCtree. 

+ *Tiliquini_MCMCtree_wFossils.tre*: time-calibrated tree estimated from MCMCtree, with fossil taxa grafted in following ages and positions estimated in the BEAST analysis. 

+ *Tiliquini_BEAST.tre*: time-calibrated tree estimated from combined-evidence analysis in BEAST v1.8.4.
