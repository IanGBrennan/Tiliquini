# Trees

+ *BayesTraits_VarRates_Egerniinae_MorphTraits_Scalar.trees*: a nexus file of median-scalar transformed trees for each morphological trait. 

+ *Tiliquini_AllLoci.trees*: IQTREE estimated locus trees for all AHE loci. 

+ *Tiliquini_forR.tre*: time-calibrated tree trimmed down to species level for comparative analyses.

+ *Tiliquini_hASTRAL.tre*: species tree estimated by hybrid-ASTRAL using the IQTREE estimated locus trees (above) as input. 

+ *Tiliquini_MCMCtree.tre* time-calibrated tree estimated from MCMCtree.
