# Evolving Novel Morphotypes by Bursts
Documentation for *Morphological novelty evolves by bursts in a continental radiation of skinks*

This project focuses on the tempo and mode of evolution of novel morphologies by looking at the morphological evolution of Tiliquini skinks. This includes a phylogenomic estimate of species-level relationships for the group. If you're here, you've probably already read the paper.
