# Data

This directory holds a number of RData files that are intermediate steps through the analysis workflow. Their content and use is outlined in the [Workflow](https://github.com/IanGBrennan/Tiliquini/tree/main/Walkthrough).

If you are interested in the morphological data (raw or processed), it's available in the following files:

+ *Tiliquini_Morphology.csv*: comma separated file holding the raw morphological measurements and associated metadata.

+ *Tiliquini_Morphology_spMEANS.csv*: comma separated file of the species mean trait data. 

+ *Egernia_Data.RData*: processed (size-corrected) morphological trait data and phylogeny.
