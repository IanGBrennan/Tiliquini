# Data

This directory holds a number of RData files that are intermediate steps through the analysis workflow. Their content and use is outlined in the [Workflow](https://github.com/IanGBrennan/Tiliquini/tree/main/Walkthrough). 

\  

If you are interested in the morphological data (raw or processed), it's available in the following files:

+ *Tiliquini_Morphology.csv*: comma separated file holding the raw morphological measurements and associated metadata.

+ *Tiliquini_Morphology_spMEANS.csv*: comma separated file of the species mean trait data. 

+ *Tiliquini_Data.RData*: processed (size-corrected) morphological trait data and phylogeny. 

If you're interested in the BEAST analysis, the xml file is here:

+ *Tiliquini_100mil_GTR_frangens_noCont.xml*

Input and results files for BayesTraits are in the `BayesTraits/` directory:

+ *[]_ModuleResults.txt*: Result files processed with PPPostProcessor.

+ *VarRates_AustraliaOnly_Files.zip*: Files from Australia-Only BayesTraits runs.

+ *VarRates_Tiliquini_Files.zip*: Files from all Tiliquini BayesTraits runs.

+ *VarRates_Control_Prior_Files.zip*: VarRates control and prior files for VR analyses.

+ *VarRates_FossilComparison.zip*: Files from VR analysis including fossil data.

+ *VarRates_InputFiles.zip*: Input trait files

+ *VarRates_InputTrees.zip*: Input tree files

+ *VarRates_ModuleResults.zip*: File outputs from VR analyses of modules of all Tiliquini. 

+ *VarRates_TraitResults.zip*: File outputs from VR analyses of traits of all Tiliquini.
