# Scripts

Scripts used to analyze morphological data and generate figures for this manuscript. 

+ *Calculate_AICs.R*: helper functions for calculating AIC values from log-likelihoods.

+ *morphotrajectory.R*: functions for the sim-to-node and distance-btwn-node plots presented in Figure 6, and the morphotrajectory plots in Figure 5.

+ *PLOT_innovate_elaborate.R*: functions for the elaborate/innovate plot of Figure 2. 

+ *PLOT_rate.trajectory.R*: script to plot the rate-trajectory plots (right column rate/trait-grams) of Figure 4. 

+ *plotting_BayesTraits.R*: functions for processing BayesTraits output files and visualizing rate heterogeneity along on the focal tree (left column trees) of Figure 4. 

+ *rate.trajectory.R*: functions used in the *PLOT_rate.trajectory.R* script, as well as for generating the rate-to-node plots of Figure 4 (center column).

+ *RUN_BayesTraits_VarRates_Likelihoods.R*: calculate AIC values for the VR model and compare against other comparative models. 

+ *RUN_pulsR.R*: script for running the common and Levy models across all morphological traits.

+ *SaveTraitsToFiles_BayesTraits.R*: helper function for writing individual morphological traits to BayesTraits input formatted files.

+ *shifts.to.simmap.l1ou.R*: functions for visualizing l1ou results.

+ *trait.at.time.R*: many functions for extracting trait, rate, and disparity metrics through time for traits and modules
